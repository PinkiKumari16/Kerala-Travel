<b><u><i> What to pack for a Kerala trip</i></u></b>

*  Comfortable clothes
*  A sunscreen
*  An Umbrella
*  Mosquito repellent
*  Sturdy footwear
*  A good quality camera

<b><u><i> Best time to plan a Kerala trip</i></u></b>

* As per me, I think while one can visit Kerala 
  throughout the year, the best time to go is 
  during the off-season since it is during this 
  period, you can avoid the tourist crowd and 
  witness the beauty of nature at your own pace. 
  Your cost of trip to Kerala also is hugely 
  impacted by the time or season you choose to 
  travel in.
